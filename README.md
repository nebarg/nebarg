## About..

Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Grant. A Developer from Yorkshire, England.

I started out [lots of years ago] with Visual Basic writing chat bots for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) which was all the rage back then. Since then I've dabbled in lots of languages, built (and abandoned) lots of personal projects but never thought I would end up coding for anything more than a hobby.

I'm primarily a backend PHP developer, with the usual mix of HTML/CSS/JS thrown in. I'm currently working hard to improve my skillset and learn all those things I skipped over when teaching myself but happen to be important when you move from hobby to income.

### Projects..

I, like most developers, have lots of projects in the pipeline, and a long list of unused domain names, but none to show just yet.

### Learning..

If you don't like learning, you shouldn't be a developer! It never ends, here's some of the stuff I'm working on;

- Laravel - I love PHP, it is definitely evolving in the right direction and Laravel seems to be pretty industry standard, so this is on my list.
- Tailwind - I don't really like CSS, it stems from the days of having to write 5 million different styles for each browser, and now we just have to write them for different viewports instead. Alas, Tailwind looks fun.
- Javascript - My JS isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, even though I don't use it a tonne.
- AlpineJS - Once I've refreshed myself on vanilla JS, I think Alpine works well with Laravel so I'll definitely be looking at this.
- Vue/React - I'm not sure about this one but I keep toying with the idea of learning a large JS framework eventually. Not sure which one yet.

### Follow me

You can find me on Twitter [@grantbennett](http://twitter.com/grantbennett) where I usually have absolutely nothing interesting to say.
