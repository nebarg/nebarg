# About..

Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Grant. A Developer from Yorkshire, England.

I started out [lots of years ago] with Visual Basic writing chat bots for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) which was all the rage back then. Since then I've dabbled in lots of languages, built (and abandoned) lots of personal projects but never thought I would end up coding for anything other than a hobby.

I'm primarily a backend PHP developer, with the usual mix of HTML/CSS/JS thrown in. I'm still working hard to improve my skillset - if you don't like learning, you shouldn't be a developer!.

## Projects..

I, like most developers, have lots of projects in the pipeline, and a long list of unused domain names, but none to show publically. I'm always chasing that golden idea so if you have something feel free to drop me a line.

## Using..

Here's some of the stuff I'm usually working with:

- Laravel - I love PHP, it is continually evolving in the right direction and Laravel makes life easier.
- Tailwind - I don't really like CSS, it stems from the days of having to write 5 million different styles for each browser, and now we just have to write them for different viewports instead. Alas, Tailwind is quite fun.
- Javascript - My JS isn't as strong as I'd like it to be so I don't touch it for ages then seem to write nothing but JS for months.
- Vue - I've just (only a few years behind the trend) started playing with Vue - it's actually making JS fun.

## Interested in..

I'm quite interested in learning Go & Rust - I think I'll end up preferring Go, but it's good to try other languages.
