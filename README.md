![Hi!](https://grantbennett.co.uk/images/cartoon_me.jpg)

## About..

Hello ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Grant. A Developer from Yorkshire.

I started out [lots of years ago] with Visual Basic writing chat bots for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) which was all the rage back then. Since then I've dabbled in lots of languages, and built (and abandoned) lots of projects but never thought I would end up doing it for an income.

I am primarily a backend developer in PHP with MySQL/MariaDB though obviously use a lot of HTML/CSS/JS.

### Current Projects..

As I can't tell you my top secret projects due to their uber coolness ðŸ˜Ž and ability to make me money ðŸ’° (obviously!), I can tell you what I'm working on learning instead..

- Laravel - I love PHP, it is definitely evolving in the right direction and Laravel seems to be pretty industry standard, so this is on my list.
- Tailwind - I don't really like CSS, it stems from the days of having to write 5 million different styles for each browser, and now we just have to write them for different viewports instead. Alas, Tailwind looks fun.
- Javascript - My JS isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, even though I don't use it a tonne.
- Vue/React - I'm not sure about this one, but I keep toying with the idea of a JS framework and these two are on my radar.

### Follow me

You can find me on Twitter [@grantbennett](http://twitter.com/grantbennett) where I have absolutely nothing interesting to say.
